* Q: Why the name "Gridsync," why not "Tahoe-LAFS desktop client," "Tahoe-LAFS-Sync," etc.?
  * A: The name "Tahoe-LAFS" is bad for the purposes of mass-adoption; even with its abreviation expanded, it does little to convey its usage or purpose to the average end-user (and the average end-user *thinks* in terms of usage patterns and end purposes). At least "Gridsync" tacitly conveys the most typical use-case for Tahoe-LAFS, i.e., the transfer of files to and from a storage grid.

* Q: What about Tahoe-LAFS's file-sharing capabilities, or its security properties?
  * A: File-sharing is a secondary property by necessity: users can synchronize files without sharing them but they can't share without synchronizing. Regarding security, it's high time that private file storage and transfer became the norm, not the exception; privacy tools fail to become adopted because they're not friendly enough or marketed towards a diverse userbase, not because their security properties aren't attractive.
